# Deep Learning Approach for Software Effort Estimation

## Introduction

Deep learning models have shown significant promise in capturing complex, non-linear relationships in data, making them ideal candidates for software effort estimation in the FinTech domain. Our research implements and evaluates multiple deep learning architectures to predict effort in person-days across four key categories: delivery, engineering, DevOps, and QA.

## Problem Background

Traditional software effort estimation methods like COCOMO and Function Point Analysis often struggle with the complexity and dynamic nature of modern software projects, especially in specialized domains like FinTech. These conventional approaches fail to account for variable project parameters such as team experience, project complexity, and shifting requirements, leading to inaccurate estimations that can result in budget overruns and project delays.

## Our Deep Learning Implementation

### Data Preparation

Before implementing our deep learning models, we conducted thorough data preprocessing:

1. **Missing Value Treatment**: Applied median imputation for numerical features and mode imputation for categorical features
2. **Normalization**: Scaled numerical features to have a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1
3. **Encoding**: Transformed categorical variables into numerical representations
4. **Data Splitting**: Divided the dataset into training (70%), validation (15%), and test (15%) sets

### Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) Model

Our MLP model was implemented using Keras with the following architecture:

```python
def create_mlp_model(input_dim, output_dim):
    model = Sequential([
        Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(input_dim,)),
        Dropout(0.3),
        Dense(64, activation='relu'),
        Dropout(0.2),
        Dense(output_dim, activation='linear')
    ])
    
    model.compile(
        optimizer=Adam(learning_rate=0.001),
        loss='mean_squared_error',
        metrics=['mae']
    )
    
    return model
```

The MLP model includes two hidden layers with ReLU activation and dropout for regularization, followed by a linear output layer for regression tasks.

### Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Model

For capturing sequential patterns in project data, we implemented an LSTM model:

```python
def create_lstm_model(input_dim, output_dim, time_steps=1):
    # Reshape input for LSTM
    input_shape = (time_steps, input_dim)
    
    model = Sequential([
        LSTM(128, return_sequences=True, input_shape=input_shape),
        LSTM(64),
        Dense(output_dim, activation='linear')
    ])
    
    model.compile(
        optimizer=Adam(learning_rate=0.001),
        loss='mean_squared_error',
        metrics=['mae']
    )
    
    return model
```

The LSTM model includes two LSTM layers followed by a dense output layer with linear activation for regression.

### Training Strategy

To improve model performance and prevent overfitting, we implemented:

1. **Early Stopping**: Monitoring validation loss with a patience of 10 epochs
2. **Learning Rate Scheduling**: Reducing the learning rate when performance plateaus
3. **Regularization**: Using dropout layers to prevent overfitting

```python
# Training configuration
early_stopping = EarlyStopping(
    monitor='val_loss',
    patience=10,
    restore_best_weights=True
)

lr_scheduler = ReduceLROnPlateau(
    monitor='val_loss',
    factor=0.5,
    patience=5,
    min_lr=0.00001
)

# Training the models
history_mlp = mlp_model.fit(
    x_train, y_train,
    epochs=100,
    batch_size=32,
    validation_data=(x_val, y_val),
    callbacks=[early_stopping, lr_scheduler]
)

history_lstm = lstm_model.fit(
    x_train_reshaped, y_train,
    epochs=100,
    batch_size=32,
    validation_data=(x_val_reshaped, y_val),
    callbacks=[early_stopping, lr_scheduler]
)
```

## Results and Analysis

Our deep learning models demonstrated impressive performance, particularly the LSTM model:

| Model | MSE | RMSE | R-Squared | MAPE (%) | MMRE |
|-------|-----|------|-----------|----------|------|
| MLP Model | 0.0126383577 | 0.1124204505 | 0.9872897078 | 209.2588731 | 2.092583468 |
| LSTM Model | 8.20E-06 | 0.002863986229 | 0.999991758 | 7.602470017 | 0.07602449747 |

The LSTM model significantly outperformed the MLP model, exhibiting drastically lower MSE and RMSE, a near-perfect R-squared value, and substantially reduced MAPE and MMRE. This suggests that sequential patterns in project data play a crucial role in accurate effort estimation.

## Model Deployment

Our DL models were deployed using FastAPI, which allows for real-time predictions and seamless integration with the frontend:

```python
@app.post("/predict", response_model=PredictionResponse)
async def predict(request: PredictionRequest):
    try:
        # Convert input data to DataFrame
        input_data = pd.DataFrame([request.dict()])
        
        # Preprocess the input data
        processed_data = preprocess_input(input_data)
        
        # Make prediction using cached model
        prediction = model.predict(processed_data)
        
        # Format the response
        response = {
            "delivery": float(prediction[0][0]),
            "engineering": float(prediction[0][1]),
            "devops": float(prediction[0][2]),
            "qa": float(prediction[0][3]),
            "total": float(np.sum(prediction[0]))
        }
        
        return response
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=str(e))
```

## Challenges and Lessons Learned

1. **Data Limitations**: Limited project records required data augmentation to reach 50,000 records for effective LSTM training
2. **Overfitting**: Addressed using dropout layers, early stopping, and learning rate scheduling
3. **Model Integration**: Ensuring seamless communication between the deep learning models and the user interface required careful data transformation pipelines

## Conclusion

Our deep learning approach, particularly the LSTM model, demonstrates superior performance in software effort estimation compared to traditional methods. By capturing complex patterns and relationships in project data, deep learning offers a promising solution for more accurate and reliable effort estimation in the FinTech domain.

Next steps include further optimizing the models, exploring ensemble approaches, and validating the system in real-world project scenarios.
